# How to use Floating Notes with Obsidian

Integrate FloatingNotes with your Obsidian vault to create a seamless note-taking experience where your floating notes automatically appear in Obsidian.

## 🎯 Overview

By changing FloatingNotes' storage location to your Obsidian vault folder, all notes created with FloatingNotes will automatically sync with Obsidian. This allows you to:

- **Create quick notes** with FloatingNotes that instantly appear in Obsidian
- **Edit notes in either app** - changes sync automatically since they're the same files
- **Leverage Obsidian's features** like linking, tags, and plugins on your floating notes
- **Maintain your Obsidian workflow** while gaining quick access to floating notes

## 📁 Step 1: Find Your Obsidian Vault Folder

1. **Open Obsidian**
2. **Right-click any file** in your vault (in the file explorer sidebar)
3. **Select "Show in system explorer"** (or "Reveal in Finder" on macOS)
4. **Copy the folder path** - this is your Obsidian vault directory

## 📝 Step 3: Optional Folder Organization

For better organization, you can create a subfolder in your Obsidian vault specifically for FloatingNotes:

1. **Create a "Quick Notes" folder** in your Obsidian vault
2. **Set this subfolder** as your FloatingNotes storage location
3. **Benefits**:
   - Keeps floating notes organized
   - Easy to distinguish from other Obsidian notes
   - Can set up specific Obsidian templates for this folder
